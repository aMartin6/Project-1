# Project-1

For this project, I modeled the motion of an anahrmonic oscillator. Specifically, I looked at how the period of an oscillator varies based on the amplitude. I modeled this using various potential functions, including that of a harmonic oscillator, and higher order potential functions such as $V(x) = x^4$. I also decided to model the motion of a pendulum. I compared the potential well of a pendulum to the potential well of a harmonic oscillator, and I showed that pendulums are slightly anharmonic at large angles.
