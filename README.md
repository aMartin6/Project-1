# Project-1

This project provides a general function for modeling anharmonic oscillators using Romberg integration. I used this to determine how the period of an oscillator varies based on its amplitude. It includes multiple examples of potential functions, including that of a harmonic oscillator, and higher order potential functions such as V(x) = x^4. The potential well and the period vs amplitude are plotted for each case. This project also models the motion of a pendulum. It compares the potential well of a pendulum to the potential well of a harmonic oscillator, and it shows that pendulums are slightly anharmonic at large angles.  
The main file of this project, _Modeling the Anharmonic Oscillator.ipynb_ is a Jupyter Notebook file that uses the modules math, numpy, pylab, and a file called Romberg that is also included in this repository. The overall code was written for the purpose of visualizing various types of oscillators, but the functions used can be applied towards any type of oscillator as long as the equation for the potential well is known.
